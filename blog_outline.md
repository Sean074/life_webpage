## Pages

### Landing Page — `/`
- Brief intro (name, one-line bio)
- Links to the main public sections: Blog, Gallery
- No hero image, no animation — plain text

---

### Blog — `/blog` (public)
- Lists all published posts (title, date, tags) — most recent first
- Shows last 3 posts on landing page
- Individual post: `GET /blog/<slug>` — Markdown rendered to HTML, 65ch measure
- Admin only: new post (`POST /blog/new`), edit (`POST /blog/<slug>/edit`), delete (`POST /blog/<slug>/delete`)
- Posts stored as Markdown files in `content/posts/` with YAML frontmatter (`title`, `date`, `tags`, `draft`)
- `draft: true` posts never render publicly

---

### Gallery — `/gallery` (public)
- Sample grid of thumbnails (between 3 to 6)
- Selection of the thumbnail creates a window with the high resolution image.
- Category filter: Drawings / Paintings / Photography
- Lazy-load thumbnails.
- Images referenced by path in DB; assets in `content/art/`
- Admin only: upload images (### Gallery — `/gallery_load` (restricted — any logged-in admin))
    - Images can be uploaded through a page in the private section.
    - Images may need to be rotated from their default. This should be done prior to creation of the thumbnail, so the thumbnail has the correct orientation.
    - Loading the image creates the thumbnail and updates the gallery db.

---

### Login — `/login`
- Simple username + password form
- Rate-limited POST
- Redirects to `/` on success
- `GET /logout` clears session

---
